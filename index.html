            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p class="summary">Summary: Christian. Web developer. Musician, writer, photographer. Student.</p>
            <p>Greetings! I don't usually talk much about myself, but because you are here, you are obviously interested in hearing at least a little bit more about me.
                <br><br>So here you go:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I'm a Christian. I love the Lord Jesus Christ, and strive to glorify Him (make Him known as He is) in what I do.</li>
                    <li>I'm a developer. I currently work as an independent contractor for a
                        growing, web development agency with a focus on ecommerce.</li>
                    <li>I work daily with Magento, PHP, MySQL, and Javascript.</li>
                    <li>I'm a musician, and I can play at least five instruments proficiently.</li>
                    <li>I write at <a href="http://1loveforchrist.com">1LoveforChrist</a></li>
                    <li>I'm also a student, working on a degree in Computer Science.</li>

            <h3>Not about me</h3>
            <p class="summary">Summary: It's actually not about me. I really love Jesus, and it's all about Him.</p>
            <p class="body">
                That's right. Contrary to the philosophy we all naturally believe, it's not all about us.
                I know, it can be a shocker when you first realize that there's more to life than you.
                I realized that at a young age, being one of eight siblings. My parents raised us with a focus
                on eternity, love, and faith - in short, they raised us to prioitize the Lord Jesus.

                    <li>I've seen the Majesty, Glory, and Beauty of <a href="#jesus"> my Savior</a>. And that defines me more than anything else.</li>
